        Leo is a human from an alternate earth, his story begins
        with his village being massacred by the local tyrant. Leo
        loses his parents and six brother's during the raid. His
        entire village is burnt down leaving little more than the
        pit him and few other children hid in. After the raid Leo
        surveys the land where his family's hut once stood, and
        found nothing but the swords belonging to his father,
        brothers and mother surrounding the area. Leo and
        the other children live out of the pit for some time
        scavaging for food only when the coast is clear. Eventually
        Leo is forced to lead the kids away from the scorched lands
        because food has grown scarce due to the lack of vegetation
        and the growing needs of the children. During the children's
        travels they stumble upon a group of monks who take them in
        and care for them. All of the children are content living
        a peaceful conflict free existence except for Leo who is
        still troubled by the incident that cost him his family.
        Leo spends all of his time working through his anger by
        learning the martial arts from the monks. Eventually Leo
        becomes known as the juggling swordsman.
