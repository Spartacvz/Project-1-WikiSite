            Orphaned at a young age, Archi grew up in Spain and
            bounced around orphanages until he was adopted by a master
            pianist, Silvio. Archi was the apprentice to his new parent
            and had a natural gift for music. Unfortunately being a
            pianist doesn't make you wealthy and his teacher had a debt
            with the local mob. When Silvio was unable to pay his debt,
            the mob took Archi as leverage. Silvio became desperate but
            was still unable to come up with the cash. In an attempt to
            rescue Archi, Silvio guaranteed his death. The mobsters
            locked Archi in a piano and tossed it into the sea.  As he
            sunk, Archi violently struggled to break free, hitting all
            the strings and setting off so much noise within the piano.
            The deeper he got the more he screamed and fought but the
            pressure of the deep sea compressed his struggle, but then
            the compression forced the vibrations of his yelling and the
            piano into his body and manipulated his DNA. As Archi
            continued to fight, his body began to vibrate to a speed
            that allowed him to pass through his restraints and through
            the Piano and he launched himself to the surface. In awe of
            what had happened, Archi rushed back to tell his father,
            only to find Silvio murdered in their home. Through his
            frustration and grief Archi realized that what had happened
            to him in that piano not only left him with the ability to
            manipulate sound waves, but also left him deaf. Although he
            could no longer hear, he could still feel the vibration from
            sound all around him and through him. Frustrated and
            vengeful, Archi tracked down and confronted the mob and in a
            fit of rage let out a piercing screech which left them deaf,
            dumb, and blind, bleeding from their ears and eyes. Archi
            developed his powers so that he could focus his energy
            through his hands and voice, producing waves of vibration
            that could move objects, cripple others (mentally through
            pitch), mimic voices and sounds, pass through objects, and
            even fly, with the right gear. As no stranger to the
            corruption and violence that he faced before his adoption,
            Archi swore to protect those who could not protect
            themselves and took on the alter ego "Sordo" meaning deaf
            in Spanish. Also having been introduced to the high end
            lifestyles through his performances with Silvio, Archi has
            been able to maintain his image as a pianist. His suit
            consists of a black wing suit/cape (similar to Batman) that
            allows him to fly, and the rest of his costume is a black
            suit and bowtie, just like a pianist and a full cover white
            mask (similar to Spiderman, but without any eyes or patterns.
            He has a slender but muscular build.
