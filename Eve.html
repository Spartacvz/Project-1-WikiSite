            Eve is a bio mechanical engineer for the US Government. She
            worked for 2 decades developing technology that allowed soldiers
            injured in battle to gain bio-mechanical limbs which not only
            restored their bodies but enhanced their speed, reflexes and
            strength to make them better soldiers. Eventually, Eve began a
            new set of research that would allow mechanical devices that
            could restore and enhance senses such as site and hearing to
            allow those with disabilities to to serve in combat and provide
            the government with a wider pool of soldiers. Just as she was
            reaching a breakthrough discovery, Dr. Eve began to experience
            headaches, light sensitivity and vision lost. After loosing her
            ability to stand bright light at all, Dr. Eve went into the
            infirmary on base to discover that she had a degenerative eye
            disease that would eventually take away her sight completely.
            Determined to take this matter into her own hands, Eve worked
            tirelessly to create a prototype of the glasses she'd invented
            to restore vision. When she was finished she cautiously tested
            the device on her own face. Once activated, Dr. Eve was horrified
            to find that the glasses were emitting a strange purple smoke and
            felt like they were cemented to her face. Panicked, she looked
            around the lab for a way to pry them off but then realized that
            the room appeared pitch black but she could see everything. Her
            vision had no been restored but somehow she was able to create
            darkness her and therefore be able to see using night vision
            through the glasses.
