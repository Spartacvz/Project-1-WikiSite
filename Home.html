        <h1>Aries</h1>
        <p>
            Aries is from a different realm, similar to earth.
            His father is currently the emperor and his grand-father was the general before the current general.
            His grand-father was the general that conquered the planet, but there are currently uprisings in the regions.
            Aries was originally training to be a spy for his father but when his father won the final battle it was no longer needed.
            Aries then changed career paths and set his sights on becoming the next general.
            Every three years anyone in the military ranks are granted the opportunity to compete for promotion.
            The competition starts out with three contest that test an individualâ€™s military skills (marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, combat strategy)
            Each contest has three sections, anyone in the lead after the final contest has come to a conclusion may challenge the current general for his rank
            This challenge is carried out by way of a duel which usually results in the death of one competitor.
            When Aries is pulled from his world he is in the middle of this challenge.
        </p>

        <h1>Leo</h1>
        <p>
            Leo is a human from an alternate earth, his story begins
            with his village being massacred by the local tyrant. Leo
            loses his parents and six brother's during the raid. His
            entire village is burnt down leaving little more than the
            pit him and few other children hid in. After the raid Leo
            surveys the land where his family's hut once stood, and
            found nothing but the swords belonging to his father,
            brothers and mother surrounding the area. Leo and
            the other children live out of the pit for some time
            scavaging for food only when the coast is clear. Eventually
            Leo is forced to lead the kids away from the scorched lands
            because food has grown scarce due to the lack of vegetation
            and the growing needs of the children. During the children's
            travels they stumble upon a group of monks who take them in
            and care for them. All of the children are content living
            a peaceful conflict free existence except for Leo who is
            still troubled by the incident that cost him his family.
            Leo spends all of his time working through his anger by
            learning the martial arts from the monks. Eventually Leo
            becomes known as the juggling swordsman.
        </p>

        <h1>Negas</h1>
        <p>
            Negas' story begins far away on the planet Segan. The
            planet Segan used to be a world of many Nations until a
            tyrant, nicknamed the dawg beast, took over and destroyed
            everything. From the ashes of destruction rose a new mild
            mannered civilization solely focused on enjoying and
            preserving life.
            </br>
            Negas, also known as the Dawg Beast. Negas is from
            another planet in which his family are the elites (royalty)
            and he's the outcast. A totalitarian monarchy is what rules
            the planet of Segan. All war and most violence had been
            stamped out thousands of years before thanks to the
            tyrannical rule of an emperor known as the Dawg Beast!
            Negas' last day on his planet he rescues his brother from
            the rebellion by awakening the spirit of the dog beast. In
            doing so he becomes banned from his home planet.
        </p>

        <h1>Sordo</h1>
        <p>
            Orphaned at a young age, Archi grew up in Spain and
            bounced around orphanages until he was adopted by a master
            pianist, Silvio. Archi was the apprentice to his new parent
            and had a natural gift for music. Unfortunately being a
            pianist doesn't make you wealthy and his teacher had a debt
            with the local mob. When Silvio was unable to pay his debt,
            the mob took Archi as leverage. Silvio became desperate but
            was still unable to come up with the cash. In an attempt to
            rescue Archi, Silvio guaranteed his death. The mobsters
            locked Archi in a piano and tossed it into the sea.  As he
            sunk, Archi violently struggled to break free, hitting all
            the strings and setting off so much noise within the piano.
            The deeper he got the more he screamed and fought but the
            pressure of the deep sea compressed his struggle, but then
            the compression forced the vibrations of his yelling and the
            piano into his body and manipulated his DNA. As Archi
            continued to fight, his body began to vibrate to a speed
            that allowed him to pass through his restraints and through
            the Piano and he launched himself to the surface. In awe of
            what had happened, Archi rushed back to tell his father,
            only to find Silvio murdered in their home. Through his
            frustration and grief Archi realized that what had happened
            to him in that piano not only left him with the ability to
            manipulate sound waves, but also left him deaf. Although he
            could no longer hear, he could still feel the vibration from
            sound all around him and through him. Frustrated and
            vengeful, Archi tracked down and confronted the mob and in a
            fit of rage let out a piercing screech which left them deaf,
            dumb, and blind, bleeding from their ears and eyes. Archi
            developed his powers so that he could focus his energy
            through his hands and voice, producing waves of vibration
            that could move objects, cripple others (mentally through
            pitch), mimic voices and sounds, pass through objects, and
            even fly, with the right gear. As no stranger to the
            corruption and violence that he faced before his adoption,
            Archi swore to protect those who could not protect
            themselves and took on the alter ego "Sordo" meaning deaf
            in Spanish. Also having been introduced to the high end
            lifestyles through his performances with Silvio, Archi has
            been able to maintain his image as a pianist. His suit
            consists of a black wing suit/cape (similar to Batman) that
            allows him to fly, and the rest of his costume is a black
            suit and bowtie, just like a pianist and a full cover white
            mask (similar to Spiderman, but without any eyes or patterns.
            He has a slender but muscular build.
        </p>

        <h1>Tonia</h1>
        <p>
            Tonia's story begins in Egypt where her parents were both
            special forces operatives. A short while before her birth
            her parents faked their deaths and made plans to flee the
            country. Before they made it out the country the father
            died, sacrificing himself to protect his family. Tonia grew
            into a woman and became an excellent gymnast which led to
            her mother's death. The fame of being a gymnast awakened old
            enemies and gave them a trail to follow. This is what lead
            Tonia to quit gymnastics and hone her other talents.
        </p>

        <h1>Eve</h1>
        <p>
            Eve is a bio mechanical engineer for the US Government. She
            worked for 2 decades developing technology that allowed soldiers
            injured in battle to gain bio-mechanical limbs which not only
            restored their bodies but enhanced their speed, reflexes and
            strength to make them better soldiers. Eventually, Eve began a
            new set of research that would allow mechanical devices that
            could restore and enhance senses such as site and hearing to
            allow those with disabilities to to serve in combat and provide
            the government with a wider pool of soldiers. Just as she was
            reaching a breakthrough discovery, Dr. Eve began to experience
            headaches, light sensitivity and vision lost. After loosing her
            ability to stand bright light at all, Dr. Eve went into the
            infirmary on base to discover that she had a degenerative eye
            disease that would eventually take away her sight completely.
            Determined to take this matter into her own hands, Eve worked
            tirelessly to create a prototype of the glasses she'd invented
            to restore vision. When she was finished she cautiously tested
            the device on her own face. Once activated, Dr. Eve was horrified
            to find that the glasses were emitting a strange purple smoke and
            felt like they were cemented to her face. Panicked, she looked
            around the lab for a way to pry them off but then realized that
            the room appeared pitch black but she could see everything. Her
            vision had no been restored but somehow she was able to create
            darkness her and therefore be able to see using night vision
            through the glasses.
